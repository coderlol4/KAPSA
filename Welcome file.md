Bored of X-SAMPA? Try KAPSA!

KAPSA is an ASCII encoding of IPA created in 2022 by Calculovo#5796. It was made due to dissatisfaction with X-SAMPA. 

X-SAMPA is based on a European transcription system, SAMPA before becoming international. SAMPA's smaller scope meant it didn't need to use digraphs which gives X-SAMPA weird holdover choices such as capital Q for ɒ. Secondly, it uses characters too liberally as seemingly random and sometimes with questionable logic. Even ignoring SAMPA's  holdovers, you still have stuff like an acute (´) for ʲ, a holdover from a different system, 5 for l̴ because 5 was just leftover, despite being the other different ways to write it by simply using a diacritic, >\ and <\  for ʢ and ʡ, literally all diacritic. Three, it is confusing at times. Four, it looks ugly. This one is a bit more personal, but look at this:

     
`X-SAMPA: [Eks-\s"{mp_h@ I"z-\64}l'i "hId'i@s]`
    
   IPA: [ʔɛks‿sˈæmpʰə ɪˈz‿ɐɾʉlʲi ˈhɪdʲiəs]

 This looks really ugly in my opinion.
 
 KAPSA fixes these problems by:
 First, being designed international from the start
 Second, attempting a more consistent logic to the choices of symbols, refusing to use weird substitutions.
 Third, avoiding ambiguous symbols, giving each symbol in the IPA its own code, distinct from all others with only one exception: this diacritic:  ̴ because you can just use ˠ or ˤ.
 Four, aesthetics. Look at this:
`KAPSA: k[?Eks;s'a*mp^h@ I'z;9Ru*l^ji 'hId^ji@s]`
Just beautiful.

Anyways that's it.
I used a bunch of `replace()`s, so it wasn't that hard.
the  end.
